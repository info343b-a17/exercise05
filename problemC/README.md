# Problem C

In this exercise, you will practice working with event-driven programming to create an interactive drawing application!

To complete the exercise, edit the included **`js/index.js`** file to add in the code described in the comments. Note that you should ___not___ edit the HTML file!

You can see the results of your work by opening up the included `index.html` file in a browser. Remember to refresh the page after you update your code, and to check for any errors in the Developer console.

## Testing
This exercise includes a test suite to verify **ONLY** the syntax of your code. It will **NOT** check the functionality of your work. We will be checking the drawing you save in the `img/` folder to give you credit!

You can run the test suite using

```bash
jest problemC
```
