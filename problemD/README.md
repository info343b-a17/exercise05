# Problem D

In this exercise, you will practice creating an interactive web page using the [**jQuery**](http://jquery.com/) library.

To complete the exercise, edit the included **`js/index.js`** file to add in the code described in the comments. Note that you ___WILL___ need to edit the HTML file to include the jQuery script!.

You can see the results of your work by opening up the included `index.html` file in a browser. Remember to refresh the page after you update your code, and to check for any errors in the Developer console.

## Testing
This exercise includes a test suite to verify that you have provided the required functionality. Note that this test is simply to help you verify your results; it will not ensure that your code follows the required syntactical approach.

You can run the test suite using

```bash
jest problemD
```
